# Pneumonia Detection Web App
This is my project on pneumonia detection using deep learning.  
The web app takes a chest X-ray image as input and predicts whether the person has pneumonia or not.  
Itâ€™s a simple and easy-to-use application that I built to apply what I learned in AI and web development.

## About the Project
I trained a convolutional neural network on a chest X-ray dataset to classify the images as *Normal* or *Pneumonia*.  
Then I integrated the model into a simple web interface where users can upload an image and see the result instantly.  
The main goal was to make an easy-to-use pneumonia detection system that runs in the browser.
